    <!-- Ingredients -->
    <h4> Ingredients </h4>
    <ul> 
        <li>filet mignon steaks (6-8 oz)</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>Optional: minced garlic, fresh herbs like thyme or rosemary</li>
    </ul>
    <h4> Cooking Instructions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li> <strong>Preparation:</strong> Remove the filet mignon steaks from the refrigerator and let them sit at room temperature for about 30 minutes to ensure even cooking.
            <br>Season both sides of each steak generously with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li> <strong>Cooking:</strong>Heat a skillet (preferably cast iron) over medium-high heat until it's very hot.
            Add olive oil to the skillet and swirl to coat the bottom.
            <br>Carefully place the seasoned filet mignon steaks in the hot skillet, ensuring they are not overcrowded.
            Cook the steaks for 3-4 minutes on each <br>side for medium-rare doneness, or adjust the cooking time according to your preferred level of doneness.</li>
        <li> <strong>Finishing:</strong> During the last minute of cooking, add butter to the skillet along with optional minced garlic and fresh herbs.
            <br>Use a spoon to baste the steaks with the melted butter and herbs, infusing them with extra flavor.</li>
        <li> <strong>Resting and Serving:</strong> Once cooked to your desired doneness, transfer the filet mignon steaks to a plate or cutting board and let them rest for 5 minutes. 
            <br>This allows the juices to redistribute, resulting in a juicier steak.
            Slice the filet mignon against the grain into thick slices and serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
